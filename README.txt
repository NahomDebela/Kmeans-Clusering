The data I analyzed "cancer.csv" represents "Gene Expression". Each row in the data set corresponded to a different patient,
labeled as either having a recurrence of cancer or not. The records represent different genes and how much more or less
the gene is present in that patient. My goal was to find out if there was a distinctive
pattern of gene expression between the two categories of patients.

I plotted my results in the form of a heat map using the plotting library Matplotlib. In my results I was able to visually
see that there was indeed a distinctive pattern of gene expression between the two categories of patients
